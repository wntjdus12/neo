The meaning of life is a question that has puzzled philosophers and individuals for centuries. There isn't one definitive answer, as it’s often deeply personal and subjective. However, many believe it revolves around connection – connecting with others, with nature, with our passions, and with something larger than ourselves. It can be found in love, kindness, creativity, learning, growth, and contributing positively to the world. Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.
