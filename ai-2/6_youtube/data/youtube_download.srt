1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,920
I have a confession to make, but first, I want you to make a little confession to me.

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,639
In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively

3
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:38,160
little stress. Anyone? How about a moderate amount of stress? Who's experienced a lot of stress?

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,799
Yeah, me too. But that is not my confession. My confession is this. I'm a health psychologist,

5
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:53,919
and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier. But I fear that something I've

6
00:00:53,919 --> 00:01:01,759
been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress.

7
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,559
For years, I've been telling people stress makes you sick. It increases the risk of everything

8
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:14,320
from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy.

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,000
But I've changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours. Let me start with the

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,239
study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked 30,000 adults in the

11
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:35,199
United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, how much stress have you experienced

12
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:44,480
in the last year? They also asked, do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?

13
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:53,440
And then they used public death records to find out who died. Okay. Some bad news first. People

14
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,559
who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 per cent increased risk of dying.

15
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:10,800
But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health.

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,399
People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to

17
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:22,559
die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had

18
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:27,440
relatively little stress. Now, the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:35,759
tracking deaths, 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that stress

20
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:45,119
is bad for you. That is over 20,000 deaths a year. Now, if that estimate is correct, that would

21
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:50,320
make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:03:00,720
year, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV, AIDS, and homicide. You can see why the study

23
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,279
freaked me out. Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your

24
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:14,880
health. So this study got me wondering, can changing how you think about stress make you healthier?

25
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,240
And here the science says yes. When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body's

26
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:27,199
response to stress. Now, to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend that you are participants

27
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:33,440
in a study designed to stress you out. It's called the social stress test. You come into the

28
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,240
laboratory and you're told you have to give a five-minute impromptu speech on your personal

29
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,919
weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you. And to make sure you feel

30
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,479
the pressure, there are bright lights and a camera in your face, kind of like this.

31
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:59,759
And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging nonverbal feedback, like this.

32
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:16,399
Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two, a math test. And unbeknownst to you,

33
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,760
the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it. Now, we're going to all do this

34
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:32,480
together. It's going to be fun for me. Okay, I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments

35
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,200
of seven. You're going to do this out loud as fast as you can, starting with 996. Go.

36
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:49,519
Go faster. Faster, please. You're going too slow. Stop, stop, stop, stop. That guy made a mistake.

37
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:55,279
We're going to have to start all over again. You're not very good at this, are you? Okay,

38
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,679
so you get the idea. Now, if you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed

39
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:04,720
out. Your heart might be pounding. You might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat.

40
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,359
And normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very

41
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:17,519
well with the pressure. But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized,

42
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,679
was preparing you to meet this challenge? Now, that is exactly what participants were told in a

43
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:29,679
study conducted at Harvard University. Before they went through the social stress test, they were

44
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:34,959
taught to rethink their stress response as helpful. That pounding heart is preparing you

45
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,640
for action. If you're breathing faster, it's no problem. It's getting more oxygen to your brain.

46
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,880
And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance,

47
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,839
well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident, but the most fascinating finding

48
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,600
to me was how their physical stress response changed. Now, in a typical stress response,

49
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,160
your heart rate goes up and your blood vessels constrict like this.

50
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,959
And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular

51
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,160
disease. It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time. But in the study,

52
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,839
when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed like

53
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,839
this. Their heart was still pounding, but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile.

54
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:32,079
It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage.

55
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:40,399
Over a lifetime of stressful experiences, this one biological change could be the difference

56
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,359
between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s.

57
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,160
And this is really what the new science of stress reveals, that how you think about stress matters.

58
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:58,160
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to get rid of your stress.

59
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,119
I want to make you better at stress. And we just did a little intervention.

60
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,440
If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year,

61
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,040
we could have saved your life. Because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress,

62
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,959
you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself,

63
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:24,399
this is my body helping me rise to this challenge. And when you view stress in that way,

64
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,640
your body believes you, and your stress response becomes healthier.

65
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,799
Now, I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from. So we are going

66
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:42,480
to do one more intervention. I want to tell you about one of the most underappreciated aspects

67
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:50,480
of the stress response. And the idea is this. Stress makes you social. To understand the side

68
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,559
of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin. And I know, oxytocin has already

69
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:02,239
gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone,

70
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:07,920
because it's released when you hug someone. But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is

71
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:15,040
involved in. Oxytocin is a neurohormone. It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts.

72
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:23,119
It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships. Oxytocin makes you crave

73
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:28,799
physical contact with your friends and family. It enhances your empathy. It even makes you

74
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:35,359
more willing to help and support the people you care about. Some people have even suggested we

75
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:44,960
should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring. But here's what most people don't

76
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:54,640
understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part

77
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,159
of the stress response. It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes

78
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,479
your heart pound. And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to

79
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:13,280
seek support. Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel

80
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else

81
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,919
in your life is struggling so that you can support each other. When life is difficult,

82
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,520
your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you.

83
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,799
Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier?

84
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,599
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain, it also acts on your body. And one of its main

85
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:49,200
roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress.

86
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's a natural anti-inflammatory. It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.

87
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,760
But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart. Your heart has receptors for this

88
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,679
hormone. And oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage.

89
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:18,239
This stress hormone strengthens your heart. And the cool thing is, is that all of these physical

90
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:24,719
benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support. So when you reach

91
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:30,880
out to others under stress, either to seek support or to help someone else, you release

92
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,080
more of this hormone, your stress response becomes healthier, and you actually recover faster from

93
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:44,799
stress. I find this amazing that your stress response has a built-in mechanism for stress

94
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:52,320
resilience. And that mechanism is human connection. I want to finish by telling

95
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,960
you about one more study. And listen up, because this study could also save a life.

96
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,159
This study tracked about a thousand adults in the United States, and they ranged in age from 34 to

97
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:11,119
93. And they started the study by asking, how much stress have you experienced in the last year?

98
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:19,119
They also asked, how much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors, people in your

99
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:25,359
community? And then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died.

100
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:33,039
Okay, so the bad news first. For every major stressful life experience, like financial

101
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:42,239
difficulties or family crisis, that increased the risk of dying by 30%. But, and I hope you

102
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:49,599
are expecting a but by now, but that wasn't true for everyone. People who spent time caring for

103
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:58,400
others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying, zero. Caring created resilience.

104
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:05,760
And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable. How

105
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:13,200
you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress. When you choose to view

106
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:23,039
your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect

107
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:32,320
with others under stress, you can create resilience. Now, I wouldn't necessarily ask

108
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,119
for more stressful experiences in my life, but this science has given me a whole new appreciation

109
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:49,440
for stress. Stress gives us access to our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning

110
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,640
in connecting with others. And yes, you're pounding physical heart, working so hard to

111
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:04,559
give you strength and energy. And when you choose to view stress in this way, you're not just getting

112
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:11,200
better at stress, you're actually making a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can

113
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:19,359
trust yourself to handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to

114
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:22,080
face them alone. Thank you.

115
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,039
I mean, this is kind of amazing what you're telling us. It seems amazing to me that a belief

116
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,039
about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy. How would that extend

117
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,320
to advice? Like if someone's making a lifestyle choice between, say, a stressful job and a

118
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,280
non-stressful job, does it matter which way they go? That it's equally wise to go for the stressful

119
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,440
job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense? Yeah. And one thing we know

120
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,320
for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort.

121
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,640
And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions, is go after what it is that

122
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,559
creates meaning in your life, and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.

123
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,799
Thank you so much, Kelly.
